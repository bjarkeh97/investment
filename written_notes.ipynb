    "This project is a basic project to test the idea of quantitative asset management. It will employ ideas from Modern Portfolio Theory used to distribute funds between asset for an investment portfolio. For profit and risk evaluation different methods will be employed - these should vary from basic expectation and variance to ARMA/GARCH modelling to ML models using financial and technical data."
